Short step-by-step guide to doing quantitative research

This guide presents core steps for carrying out quantitative research that examines whether and why something causes something else (causal inference) when conducting an experiment is not possible. For people relatively new to research, the amount of information and techniques for how to do research can be overwhelming. There are always many ways to approach a research question, many issues to be aware of, and many tools for dealing with these issues. The following documents attempt to boil the research process down to essentials and so help people navigate which steps and issues are the most important for getting a reasonable answer to a research question and which techniques and issues are secondary and can be set aside initially.

[Part 1](https://rawgit.com/andymartens/core_research_steps_guide/master/Part1Methodology.html) presents a step-by-step guide to thinking about research methodology and designing an analysis.

[Part 2](https://rawgit.com/andymartens/core_research_steps_guide/master/Part2AnalyzingData.html) presents a step-by-step guide to carrying out the actual statistical analyses and data visualization.
