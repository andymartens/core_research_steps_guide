Short step-by-step guide to doing quantitative research

This guide presents a guide to carrying out quantitative research that examines whether and why something causes something else (causal inference). For people relatively new to research, the amount of information and techniques for how to do research is overwhelming. Textbooks are hundreds of pages and contain a large amount of information to process and synthesize. There are always many ways to approach a research question, a large number of issues to be aware of, and an enormous number of corresponding tools and techniques for dealing with these issues. The following documents attempt to boil the research process down to the essentials -- to help navigate which steps and issues are the most important for getting a reasonable answer to the question being asked and which techniques and issues are secondary and can be set aside at least for the time being.

[Part 1](https://rawgit.com/andymartens/core_research_steps_guide/master/Part1Methodology.html) presents a step-by-step guide to thinking about research methodology and designing an analysis. 

[Part 2](https://rawgit.com/andymartens/core_research_steps_guide/master/Part2AnalyzingData.html) presents a step-by-step guide to carrying out the actual statistical anlayses and data visualization.
